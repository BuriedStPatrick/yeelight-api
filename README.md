# Yeelight NodeJS API
A simple REST-like NodeJS express API for manipulating Yeelight.

## Setup and install packages
```
yarn
```

## Build

```
yarn build
```

This will output the app to `./build/index.js` which can be run with `node ./build/index.js`.

## Run with live reload for development
```
yarn start
```

This will start the ts-node-dev watcher and automatically recompile and re-run the API when changes are made to source-files.
